          <p>Never in all their history have men been able truly to conceive of the world as one: a single sphere, a
            globe, having the qualities of a globe, a round earth in which all the directions eventually meet, in which
            there is no center because every point, or none, is center — an equal earth which all men occupy as equals.
            The airman's earth, if free men make it, will be truly round: a globe in practice, not in theory.</p>

          <p>What was most significant about the lunar voyage was not that man set foot on the Moon but that they set
            eye on the earth.</p>

          <p>For those who have seen the Earth from space, and for the hundreds and perhaps thousands more who will, the
            experience most certainly changes your perspective. The things that we share in our world are far more
            valuable than those which divide us.</p>

          <p>There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a
            task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of
            just beginning.</p>

          <p>Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men. It is a
            historical process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human
            development.</p>

          <p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a
            marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so
            delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a
            man.</p>
